What is this?
-------------------

I was working something for a client, poking around the Inspector tool, and I noticed the css color for something was #c0ffee.

I thought, how cool is this? and it's actually a nice blue.

Then I thought, could there be more hex colors like this?

I started with a Scrabble dictionary to come up with words containing ABCDEF. But it ended up being not that exciting of a list. So what could I do with 0, 1, and 5 in my hex values?
- 0 = the letter O
- 1 = the letters L or I, sometimes in the same word :D
- 5 = the letter S, which probably tripled the list

70+ words later, I wanted to make a script to cycle through the next hex colors. Just for fun.

Here's a full list if you want spoilers:
